# Malaysia Media Neutrality Study

## Introduction
Recently, especially in the aftermath of recent Malaysian general election (PRU15), there is a strong polarisation in the Malaysian political landscape [citation needed]. However this polarisation is not strictly ideological like in the case of western democracies (i.e. left/right, liberal/conservative) but mostly in the form of political parties, personalities, and races (i.e. identity politics) [citation needed]. There is no simple way to guage the leanings of the news providers because the latest government are made of conflicting entities. The prolavity of the news may be easy to identify in the past due to strong coalition majority in the ruling government resulting in having unchallenged control of mainstream media (which need to be tested in this study).

Main dimensions of the study are news providers, political entities, time, and topics. Study metrics and measures may be in the forms of sentiments (favor vs negative), sentiments changes (change of leanings), and relationships betweens dimensions (graph analysis i.e. centralities, ranks, etc.).


## Problem Statements
1. Unknown/confusing leanings of news providers
2. Echo-chambers [need explaining] and polarisation


## Research Questions (very rough ideas)
1. News providers are leaning towards which party/coalition/government/politician?
2. What are relationships betwen politician, party, coalition, articles, news providers?
3. Who influence news providers?
4. Are there any change of leaning/"allegience" through time? (by year or when coalition changed)
5. What are the topic focused by party/coalition/government/politician?
6. Can intensity of topics discussion be observed through time? (time-series)
7. What are the topics?
8. ...and many more.

## Research Objectives
1. to gain understanding of the news providers leanings toward political entities.
2. to investigate changes of leanings over time.
3. to find relationships between news providers, political entities, and topics.

## Research Scoping (eventual scope)
1. Find/list top news providers. Limit to national/non-regional news provider. Exclude regional.
2. Find/list all entities (political parties/ coalitions/ governments/ politicians)
3. Time frame: approximately 180 months around 2007 - 2023
4. Location: Malaysia
5. Domain: Only Federal entities. Exclude states or region entities.
6. News source scraping method: Google news rss links
7. Analysis will purely based on textual data from news articles while entirely ignoring other factors such as news providers funding, advertisers, publishing city, owners, authors,  However, those factors (if accesible) can become the external validation method to see if there are correlations.
8. Limit to only English and Malay (i.e. latin alphabets)


## Expected Challenges
1. Pay wall
2. Broken links
3. Multi languages i.e. English, Malay, Indian, Chinese
4. Large volume of news articles
5. Limiting to English and Malay news will inherently produce bias to result [need solution].


## Research Methods
1. Topic Modeling
2. Sentiment Analysis
3. Graph/ Network analysis


## Expected Results
1. News providers political leanings
2. Topics rankings
3. Leaning changes through time
4. Entities rankings (Page rank)

## Conclusion
Malaysia is a thriving democracy and media is one of the pillar and need to be protected and valued by both the people and the ruling government. Economist categorized Malaysia in 2022 as a [flawed democracy](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/02/01/the-worlds-most-and-least-democratic-countries-in-2022) which is at par with the U.S., Italy, and India. I believe in order for Malaysia to move toward mature democracy, people have the right to make free decision to consume media of their choice as long as they fully understand the bias behind the news providers. The knowledge of this bias will also provide the people with the opportunity to escape the echo chamber.


## Notes
This idea come about one fine afternoon while studying for my final exam when I suddenly thought of an idea to find media bias in Malaysia as inspired by the website [ground.news](https://ground.news/). I have a little experience in topic modelling, sentiment analysis, and graph analysis which may be the core methods in the development of this study. This github is to document the thought process of developing this study. If by any chance any reader is interested to join me in this endevour please feel free to contact me via the github issues.
